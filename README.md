# PredictionOfCirrhosis-KaggleProject

This is a project about predicting a type of disease. In this data, information about the sex, the drugs that the patients take, etc., which you can see in the data, is given, and the goal is to find the status of their disease, which is placed in 3 categories: C, CL, and D. This is a classification data and it should be checked with the considered models in this field.
As always, I tried to get the best possible result from the simplest models and methods, I hope you found this notebook useful.
